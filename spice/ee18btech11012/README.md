PROCEDURE FOR RUNNING SPICE SIMULATONS IS:
1. The file ee18btech11012.net is circuit netlist for feedback circuit of unity buffer system.
2. Run the command ngspice ee18btech11012.net in the terminal of the folder
3. The following command creates ee18btech11012.dat file which gives output voltage values with respect to time
4. Import the .dat file into ee18btech11012_spiceresult.py and run the file.
5. Plot of step response verses time is observed
6.In this way, Circuit is verified
